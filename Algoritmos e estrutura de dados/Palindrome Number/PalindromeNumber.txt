Description: Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Observation: Of course i could converting to string and compare with the inverse.

if str(x)==str(x)[::-1]:
      return True
return False

But that's an easier thought to arrive at, so i wanted to do it without conversion.

Solution: The difficulty of this problem for me was solving it without convert the integer for string. That was good, because i could think 
about how to solve it just using math, loops and branches. The method to arrive the solution is to think about how number are constructed. I needed know how many digits the number had and how i could to construct the inverse number with just math. The tip is to think of the number as the sum of numbers with
different decimals place.
Example:
245 = 200 + 40 + 5
101 = 100 + 0 + 1
24542 = 20000 + 4000 + 500 + 40 + 2
